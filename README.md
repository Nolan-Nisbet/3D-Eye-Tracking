# 3D-Eye-Tracking
3D eye tracker implemented in C++ (OpenGL) which uses convergence between each eyes gaze vector while viewing 3D redners with shutter glasses. This may have a use in a variety of applications including hands free viewing of 3D medical data sets such as MRI as well as use in the entertainment industry. I would recommend reading through the Developer Guide to get a better understanding of the software and hardware used as well as the results.
